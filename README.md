## Installation

You can download Fresh [here](https://github.com/interstateone/Fresh/releases). These releases are already Developer ID signed.

You can also download and build the source yourself. In order to build the app, you'll need a client ID and secret to communicate with the SoundCloud API. More information about the API and how to get these credentials is available on the [SoundCloud for Developers](https://developers.soundcloud.com) website. Once you have SoundCloud credentials, install cocoapods-keys with `gem install cocoapods-keys` and then `pod install`. You'll be prompted for the credentials you have now, and then you can build the app successfully.

## Contributing

If you think you've found a bug in Fresh, don't hesitate to start a conversation about it by opening an [issue](https://github.com/interstateone/Fresh/issues). If you have an idea for something you think would make Fresh even better, you can also open an issue or submit a PR with the changes you'd like to make. Fresh is deliberately small and focused on just playing the tracks on your SoundCloud dashboard, so some changes might not be accepted. But we can chat about it to find out what works best!
